An AI Chatbot is an intelligent software application designed to simulate human-like conversations with users through text or voice interactions. Powered by technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), chatbots can understand user queries, provide instant responses, and execute tasks autonomously.

AI chatbots are widely used across various industries, including customer support, healthcare, e-commerce, education, and banking, to streamline interactions, provide 24/7 assistance, and enhance user experiences. Unlike traditional rule-based bots, AI chatbots can learn from interactions, handle complex conversations, and personalize responses, making them highly effective for automating repetitive tasks and improving operational efficiency.
